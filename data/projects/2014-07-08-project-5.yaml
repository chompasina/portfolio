description:  This project uses Rails and ActiveRecord to build a versioned JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. The RailsEngine data was imported from the SalesEngine CSV files by building rake tasks. We used controller tests to drive the design, and Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence queries.
